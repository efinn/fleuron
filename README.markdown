# pelican-fleuron-theme #

This theme is minimalist, elegant, and typography-based. It relies heavily on
David Perry's excellent [Cardo](http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html) font.

It was derived from the
[cebong](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/cebong)
theme, which was in turn derived from
[notmyidea](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/notmyidea-cms).
So much has changed at this point that it resembles neither.

It's still in development, and pretty much only posts work.

You can reuse it freely, I only ask that you keep the attribution text and link on the bottom as is.
