# Fleuron

Fleuron is a [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) theme that tries
to be minimalist, elegant, and typography-based. It emulates the old
book-style. It relies heavily on David Perry's excellent
[Cardo](http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html) font. This font has a wide
range of unicode characters included, so the theme can easily be used for
non-english content.

Fleuron was derived from the
[cebong](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/cebong)
theme, which was in turn derived from
[notmyidea](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/notmyidea-cms).
So much has changed at this point that it resembles neither.

Fleuron is still in development, and pretty much only posts work. You can reuse
it freely, I only ask that you keep the attribution text and link on the bottom
as is.
