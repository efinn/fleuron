  Visual style here refers to the general "look and feel", more specifically a
  combination of visual factors including but not limited to font size, font
  face, text decorations, spacing between elements, color etc.
  
  Changes merely in layout or arrangement such adding or removing sections or
  columns, for the purposes of this license, do not constitute a substantial
  change of the visual style and therefore still require the attribution text
  and link to be clearly visible as discussed above.
  
  Some other examples of such non-substantial changes would be directly
  adapting the theme to different blogging / CMS software or minor visual
  modifications.
