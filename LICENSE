  site.
  
  Some examples of this would be adapting the theme to different blogging
  software or minor visual modifications.
  
  Changes merely in layout or arrangement such adding or removing sections or
  columns, for the purposes of this license, do not constitute a substantial
  change of the visual style and therefore still require the attribution text
  and link to be clearly visible as discussed above.
